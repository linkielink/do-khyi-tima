# do-khyi-tima
The giant herding dog from Tibet found its way into the British royal family as early as the 19th century. Queen Victoria received a Do Khyi as a gift from the then Indian Viceroy Lord Hardinge in 1847. Her eldest son Albert Edward, who later became Edward VII, was also enthusiastic about these loyal exotic animals.
